# What is a database

- special software to store data

## What's so special about database:

1. Secure
2. Multiple users
3. Backup

## Can I keep twitter DB in a laptop:

- no because too many requests will come in and crash laptop

## Where does database live?

- Cloud

# What is cloud?

- RENTING PCS( SERVERS)
- DropBox
- Google Drive - can only store data for you, but you can't run software
- Geforce- play games on cloud

# Cloud providers

- AWS (Amazon Web Services) ->2006 (Big 3)
- Netflix is AWS's biggest customer and 30% of their profit goes to paying
- Azure ( Microsoft product) (Big 3)
- Google Cloud platform (Big 3)
- Salesforce
- IBM Cloud
- Alibaba Cloud
- Oracle Cloud
- AWS is leading because they were the first to get into the cloud business

## Why buying is a problem:

- High inital cost
- Maintenance is costly -> servers run 24/7-> a lot can break
- Need spaces when something breaks and dispose of the old ones
- Need industry size generators
- Requires cooling systems -> high power bill
- You need to rent a room to store pcs/servers

## Why rent

- Disaster Management:
  - keep all servers in a place that is less disaster-prone
  - they have backups
  - 99.9% guarantee that servers will always be on
- `Scaling !!!!!!!!!!`

## How to rent?

- RAM
  - SSD(Faster) or HDD
- GPU
- CPU

# WHAT OS is in the cloud?

- Linux (most run OS)

## Linux

- it is free
- open-source( it is like community service)-> group of people coming together to build software from the goodness of their heart
  - easier to find malicious code
  - people work together to fix issues or bugs
- Secure
- small footprint- takes 250mb
- automation

- Ubuntu is beginner-friendly Linux
- Fedora
- Debian
- Linux Mint
- Manjaro
- Archlinux
- Kali - white hat hacking!!!
- Alphine- small version of Ubuntu - uses 250mbs

# Scaling

- make PC more powerful by increasing RAM and storage - Vertical Scaling
- but if PC storage has reached maximum then add more pcs - Horizontal Scaling
- when you have a big sale ( Black Friday)- there's a lot of traffic
- during this time you need more pcs
- AWS provides the auto-scaling button , you just need to turn it on and everything will run smoothly
- Auto- scaling - competition might know you are auto-scaling so they will increase traffic by putting lots of requests which will lead you to buying more servers -> they will just go to the home page to increase traffic
- use Captcha to determine malicious traffic to legitimate traffic
- use IP to capture people in other countries who are trying to cause traffic to a website that only is suitable for people in a certain country
- REDIRECT THEM ELSEWHERE
- CAPTCHA - catches bots by looking at how mouse moves -> if it moves in a straight line then it is a bot
